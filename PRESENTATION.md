## 2. Opportunity

### How is this solution different?
Unlike generic content creation tools or complex e-commerce platforms that require significant technical expertise, KalaKarvan is purpose-built for the artisan. It combines culturally-aware AI with a user-friendly interface, removing the friction typically associated with digital marketing.

### How does it solve the core problem?
KalaKarvan directly addresses the primary challenges faced by local artisans:

## 5. Wireframes / Mockups (Conceptual)

- **Dashboard Screen:** A welcoming home screen with a grid of beautifully designed cards. Each card represents a core feature (e.g., "Caption Crafter," "Photo Editor"), displaying an icon and a short description. A persistent navigation bar provides access to the Dashboard, Virtual Gallery, and Profile.
- **Photo Editor Screen:** A clean, two-panel layout. The left panel prominently displays the uploaded artisan's craft. The right panel contains a simple text input field ("Describe the changes you want...") and a "Generate" button. The AI-edited image appears below, with clear "Save to Gallery" and "Download" buttons.
- **Gallery Screen:** A visually appealing masonry grid showcasing all saved creations. Each item is a card with a preview (image, video thumbnail, or text snippet). Hovering over a card reveals options to "Copy Text," "Download," or "Delete."
